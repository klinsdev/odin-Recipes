  <h1>Pupusas </h1>
  <img src="./Pupusas.webp" alt="Pupusas image" sizes="200px">
  <p>This is a fairly authentic version of the popular Salvadorean dish. It does take some time, however it is well
    worth
    the effort! You can purchase pre-made chicharron at specialty markets, however this recipe tastes just like it. I
    also make the salsa roja and curtido ahead of time the salsa freezes very well, and the curtido can stay in the
    fridge at least a week.</p>
  <p>A popular food in El Salvador. A thick corn tortilla filled with cheese and easy to customize. Serve topped with
    curtido picked cabbage or eat plain. My ex-boyfriend's Salvadorean mother's recipe!</p>
  <h2>Ingridients</h2>
  <h3>chicharron</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 and 12 ounce packages bacon, to taste</li>
    <li></li>
    <li>4 tomatoes,halved</li>
    <li>1 green bell pepper, seeded and quartered</li>
    <li>1 cup granted Monterey Jack cheese</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>Salt to taste</li>
    <li>4 cups masa harina or more to taste</li>
    <li>2 cups water, or as needed</li>
    <li>half cup vegetable oil for frying</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Steps</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Combine tomato sauce, water, cilantro, green bell pepper, onion, crushed garlic, bouillon cube, and salt in a
      saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook and stir until vegetables are soft, about 20 minutes. Let salsa roja cool for
      10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Fill a blender halfway with the salsa roja. Cover and hold lid down with a potholder; pulse a few times before
      leaving on to blend. Pour into a bowl. Repeat with remaining salsa roja. Return to saucepan and simmer for 10
      minutes more stirring occasionally. Allow to cool completely, about 1 hour, and refrigerate.</li>
    <li>Place cabbage and carrots in a large bowl. Add 4 cups boiling water and let stand for 5 minutes. Drain well. Mix
      in vinegar, scallions, oregano, and red pepper flakes. Chill curtido until serving. </li>
    <li>Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until almost fully cooked
      and not yet crispy, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer bacon and grease (if desired) to a food processor. Add tomatoes,
      quartered green bell pepper, Monterey Jack cheese, and minced garlic. Puree and season the chicharron with salt.
    </li>
    <li>Mix masa harina and 1/2 cup water together in a bowl by hand. Add the remaining water slowly, about 2
      tablespoons at a time, mixing well after each addition, until dough is moist but still firm. Cover with a wet
      towel.</li>
    <li>Heat 1/2 cup oil a large skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
    <li>Take a golf ball-sized piece of dough and roll into a ball in your hands. Make a hole in the dough ball with
      your thumb; put a small amount of chicharron inside the hole, close it up, and flatten the ball with your hands
      into a thick tortilla shape. Place pupusa in the skillet and fry until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side.
      Repeat with the remaining dough and chicharron.</li>
    <li>Serve each pupusa topped with 2 tablespoons of curtido and 1 tablespoon of salsa roja.</li>

  </ol>
